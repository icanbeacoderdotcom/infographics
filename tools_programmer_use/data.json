	"description": "Most necessary of all the tools that a programmer uses is a computer, without which he is just as a normal human being! Apart from a computer the second most important thing is internet, without which a programmer is as dumb as a Dodo. After the internet a programmer needs a code editor, a browser and not to miss a compiler. Another important thing is coffee which is primarly used for waking up all night and doing nothing. Apart from these beer plays a vital role in inspiring a programmer to do things which he is probably afraid of doing when sober.",
